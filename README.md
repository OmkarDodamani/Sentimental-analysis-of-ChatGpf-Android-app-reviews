🔍 Unlocking Insights from ChatGPT User Reviews: A Data-Driven Approach 🚀

We are excited to share the completion of our latest project, "Sentiment Analysis of ChatGPT Android App", where we explored user feedback to uncover meaningful insights. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprised daily-updated user reviews and ratings with key columns like review content, user scores, app versions, and timestamps.

This collaborative effort between Omkar Dodamani and Dineshbabu was powered by tools like Python, libraries such as pandas, NLTK, and TextBlob, and Asana, our project management companion.

📍 Key Highlights

Data Quality Improvement: Addressed missing values and duplicates for a clean, reliable dataset.

Text Normalization: Processed reviews to remove inconsistencies and ensure textual data was analysis-ready.

Sentiment Analysis: Classified reviews into positive, neutral, and negative categories, revealing key sentiment trends over time.

Temporal Trends: Explored review patterns across different dates, days of the week, and app versions, identifying peaks post-major updates.

User Behavior Analysis: Differentiated between first-time and repeat reviewers, unveiling unique engagement patterns.


Our approach ensured task prioritization, workflow optimization, and risk mitigation, all seamlessly managed using Asana. This enabled us to deliver actionable insights effectively, supporting predictive analysis with data-driven findings.

📍 Acknowledgment

A big thank you to Kaggle and contributor Ashish Kumar for the dataset. This journey was made smoother through teamwork, clear role distribution, and robust tools.

💡 Future Scope: We aim to incorporate advanced NLP models like BERT and integrate demographic insights for deeper analysis.
